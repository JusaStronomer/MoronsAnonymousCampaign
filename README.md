## Places

* The **Yawning Portal** is a tavern with an OP barkeeper and a big whole that goes into the undermountain. We fought a troll there... and that's where we usually talk to Volo.
* The **Skewered Dragon** is another pub... the barkeeper is called John... he reminds me of Artanis. Nix had a very long talk with him.
* The **Trollskull** is our manor, in the Northward District of Waterdeep. It's in need of repairs.

## Streets

* The **Snail Street** would be the fastest one to take to go from the Yawning Portal to the docks. We couldn't use it, because there was a commotion. According to Thelis's recap of what I should have seen, 6 people were dead and 3 in cuffs (and being questioned).
* The **Candle Lane** is a street where we found a warehouse owned by the Zheterim.

## Organizations

* **Zhenterim** is a gang whose symbol is a winged serpent. According to Rennoq, they are an ancient thieves guild in Waterdeep.
* **Xanathar** is the gang with the brawl in the pub. Their symbol is a Xanathar Circle (a beholder) radiating ten spikes. Rennoq doesn't know them, so that means they are a new gang. Their hideouts are believed to be located in the big sewer network below Waterdeep.

## People

* **Volothamp 'Volo' Geddarm** is a super important author. He is the one who gave us a question to "find Raynar and Floon"(?).
* **Renor (Reynar, Raynar?) Neverember** is a noble with red hair. He is the son of Daggult Neverember, the former afce of the Council of Lords.
* **Floon Blagmaar** was seen with Renor, playing cards. He apparently knows the location of the Stone Head.
* **Daggult Neverember** is the former afce of the Council of Lords. He is also Renor's father.
* **Lorel Silverhand** is the current face of the Council of Lords.

## The story so far

We all met at the Yawning Portal. There is a whole in the middle of the pub that leads to the undermountain and people will often go down as some sort of local ritual I don't quite understand yet.

On that day, there was some brawling going on, but Nix was able to keep it from evolving into something worst by casting a Minor Illusion that convinced the brawlers to retreat. Thelis talked to the victim, but I can't remember what he found out.

On that day, a troll climbed out of the whole, along some bats, causing havok within the tavern. We all stayed to fight!

Two individuals of interest also stayed inside, instead of running away: Volo and the Barkeeper. Volo mostly watched, trying to help as it was possible, while the Barkeeper was... a monster on his own right. An accurate description of that battle was that we simply helped the Barkeeper to defeat the troll.

Volo thanked us, welcomed us to Waterdeep, gaves a copy of his enchiridion (a book of his own authorship countaining a lot of information about the city) and gave us a quest.

I don't quite remember the details of the request, because I'm ashamed although I was paying attention, I am quick to forget what I didn't note down... but from what I understand, a noble has gone missing: Renor Neverember... and we were asked to find him. Thelis or Nix might have a much better and more detailed summary of the task.

Anyway, after resting, we followed the a lead to the docks disctrict. On our way, we found a commotion at Snail Street. I went past the crowd to check it and, according to Thelis's recap of what I should have seen, 6 people were dead and 3 in cuffs (and being questioned).

We took an alternative route and arrived at a mysterious shop that sold all sorts of... purple items. I bought a bell there!

Afterwards, we found the Skewered Dragon, a tavern with a very funny barkeeper, John. Nix had a very long chat with him and, in the course of a few interviews, we figured out that Renor was seen playing cards with someone named Floon. Both of them were thorwn out of the tavern by 5 gangters (Thelis recalls that one of them had a winged snake tatto on his neck and we later associated that mark with the Zhenterim Gang).

Upon further investigation we discovered that there is a warehouse in Candle Lane with a snake symbol at the door. That's a lead on where Renor and Floon might have been taken to.

We found the warehouse, that was locked, and after a few failed attempts to pick it, we decided to brake in through the window. We were greeted by an arrow, fired by humanoid creatures in long cloaks with hoods. They were kenku, but despite Rennoq's attempt to talk to them, we couldn't understand why they were there and why they were attacking us.

It was a fierce battle, but we prevailed! 3 kenkus were killed and 1 restrained.

After the fight, we found dead bodies... there were two different kind of engravings tattoed into their bodies: some had the winged snake, while others had another symbol... that I can't remember.

Rennoq recognized the tattoes: they belong to the Zhenterim Gang and Xanathar Gang respectively. He knew nothing about the Xanathar, despite being quite knowledgeble in Waterdeep's history, which means that they are a new gang. He did know, however, quite a bit about the Zhenterim, including how they are an ancient thieves guild in Waterdeep.

Thelis concluded that there was a battle between the two gangs in that place. Since the warehouse is owned by the Zhenterim (based on the symbol at the entrance), it seems that the Xanathar assaulted the place. We are not sure how the kenkus fit in the picture, though. Unfortunately, we couln't wake up the restrained kenku to find out.

Exploring around, ringing a lot of bells and brakingn walls, we eventually found Mr Renor. 

While Nix talked to him, the others kept exploring and found a secret room, with a desk and a piece of paper above it. Rennoq realized it was magic paper and suspected it was used for communication.

We heard people approaching the warehouse... big numbers! We assumed it would could be the City Watch, so hastened to finish our investigations inside. Thelis found a leather bag holding a rod... and some silver bars. Rennoq took the magic paper.

As the City Watch started demanding we left the warehouse to reveal ourselves, we made our way to the entrance.

We were, at first, treated as suspects of the crime that had just occurred... and, to be honest, we did probably commit some law violations by breaking in. Nix tried to explain the situation, showing her bounty papers, in accordance to the Tarnsmoke Proclamation, but the guards didn't care about it. They did, however, care about the noble we had just rescued.

As a token of appreciation for our deed, they ignored the potential crimes we may had commited and dismissed us from the crime scene so they could conduct their own investigation. They even took a look at Nix's papers, in order to avoid trouble with higher authorities, although I don't remember the outcome of that.

Renor explained that there is a magical artifact that can be used to locate "The Vault". It was called the "Stone Head" and the Xanathar had possession of it until it was stolen.

The Xanathar, thus, assumed the thieves were Zhenterim and assaulted the warehouse hoping to recover it, which explains the dead bodies from both gangs we saw there.

However, meanwhile, the Zhenterim, who didn't have the artifact but were also searching for it, kidnaped Renor and Floon hoping that they would know where it is. That explains why they were taken to the warehouse.

Although we did rescue Renor, we couldn't find Floon. The red haired noble said his friend was taken by the Xanathar, to their place, somewhere below Waterdeep, in the vast sewer network. He urged us to go rescue Floon immediately, but we had not yet recovered from the battle with the kenkus.

Therefore, we took a short rest before departing for this new goal. During the rest, Thelis identified the spoils from the warehouse, finding a Paper Bird and an Immovable Rod.

Renor guided us to the closest sewer entrance... it's was locked. I failed to pick it, but Artanis just fixed the problem by smashing it. Inside the network, we found and followed markings of the Xanathar, that guided us to fight a gazer (a type of beholder) and to engage in a very uncomfortable battle against goblins archers firing through slits in a traproom.

Eventually, we found one of the peole involved in the brawling at the Yawning Portal. He was arguing with a Duergar about sealing a door with blankets. We ambushed them and, as they refused to surrender, slayed them. It was a fierce battle, since the Duergar could increase it's size by a factor of 4. Afterwards, we found melted goblin corpses and the cause of the arguing we had heard: an acid slime.

After sealing the door with blankets and checking another door, we heard screamings and carefully ventured towards it. We found Floon, our rescue target, being interrogated by an orc (Grum'shar). In that room, we also found a Mindflayer accompanied by an Intellect Devourer. After manifesting it's disappointment in the orc's ability to keep the hideout safe, the mindflayer left. Defeating the orc and the disembodied brain, we made stretchers (for Floon and Artanis, who got incapacitated in the battle) and made our way back to the surface.

Volo thanked us for completing the quest he issued, but instead of paying in gold he offered a house, Trollskull Manor, located in the Northward District. Nix was very concerned about the state of the property and of the onus that we would be accepting with it. A tiefling magistrate, that was in the tavern, clarified some of our concerns and officialized the transaction, inviting us to visit her at her office for further questions.

After our long rest, we leveled up, reaching level 2.
